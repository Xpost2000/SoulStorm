  I want to show my branding cause it's a cool and neat thing and looks like polish,
  also maybe logos of the stuff I used.

  The actual opening cutscene, I want to draw with a storyboard, or just have a small visual
  cutscene aabout my characters' parents being kidnapped and that leads to the main menu.

  It's a very "once upon a time" kind of story, and I'm not trying to write anything thought
  provoking.

  Just something a little fun.
